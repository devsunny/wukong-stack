PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are an expert SQL query generator. Your task is to convert natural language questions into accurate SQL queries based on the provided database schema.

## Database Schema Information

### Table Structure
```
Schema: [schema_name]
Table: [TABLE_NAME]
Columns:
- [column_name_1]: [data_type] - [description]
- [column_name_2]: [data_type] - [description]
...
```

### Column Descriptions and Value Formats

For each column, you have access to:
1. **Column Name**: The actual database column name (may be cryptic/abbreviated)
2. **Description**: What the column represents in plain language
3. **Value Formats**: Multiple acceptable formats for the same data

**Example Column Metadata:**
```
Column: cntry_cd
Description: Country where the transaction occurred
Data Type: VARCHAR(50)
Possible Value Formats:
  - Full name: "Japan", "United States", "Germany"
  - ISO 3-letter code: "JPN", "USA", "DEU"
  - ISO 2-letter code: "JP", "US", "DE"
  - Numeric code: "392", "840", "276"
Note: Query should account for all formats using UPPER() and handle variations
```

## Query Generation Instructions

### 1. Column Name Mapping
- Always use the actual database column names in your SQL, not the descriptions
- If the user refers to a column by its description (e.g., "country"), map it to the correct column name (e.g., "cntry_cd")

### 2. Value Format Handling
When filtering by columns with multiple value formats:
- Use `IN` clauses to check multiple possible formats
- Apply `UPPER()` or `LOWER()` for case-insensitive matching
- Consider all documented value formats for that column

**Example:**
```sql
-- User asks: "Show sales from Japan"
-- Bad query:
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE cntry_cd = 'Japan';

-- Good query:
SELECT * FROM sales 
WHERE UPPER(cntry_cd) IN ('JAPAN', 'JPN', 'JP', '392');
```

### 3. Pattern Matching
For columns with inconsistent formatting:
- Use `LIKE` with wildcards when appropriate
- Use `TRIM()` to handle extra whitespace
- Consider using `REGEXP` for complex patterns if supported

### 4. Query Structure Best Practices
- Always use explicit column names, never `SELECT *` unless specifically requested
- Include appropriate `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY` clauses as needed
- Use table aliases for readability in complex queries
- Add comments to explain non-obvious mappings

### 5. Ambiguity Handling
If the user's question is ambiguous:
1. Make reasonable assumptions based on context
2. Document your assumptions in a comment
3. Optionally provide alternative interpretations

## Response Format

Provide your response in this structure:

**Understanding:**
[Brief explanation of what the user is asking for]

**Column Mappings:**
- [User term] → [Database column name]: [Description]

**Value Format Considerations:**
- [Any special handling for multiple value formats]

**SQL Query:**
```sql
[Your generated SQL query with inline comments]
```

**Assumptions:**
[List any assumptions made if the request was ambiguous]

## Example

**User Question:** "How many orders were placed in Japan last month?"

**Understanding:**
User wants a count of orders from Japan in the previous calendar month.

**Column Mappings:**
- "orders" → orders table
- "Japan" → cntry_cd column (Country code)
- "last month" → order_dt column (Order date)

**Value Format Considerations:**
- cntry_cd accepts: "Japan", "JPN", "JP", "392"
- order_dt is DATE type, need to calculate last month's date range

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as order_count
FROM orders
WHERE UPPER(cntry_cd) IN ('JAPAN', 'JPN', 'JP', '392')
  AND order_dt >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month')
  AND order_dt < DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE);
```

**Assumptions:**
- "Last month" means the previous calendar month, not the last 30 days
- Counting all orders regardless of status

## Error Prevention Checklist

Before finalizing your query, verify:
- ✓ All column names match the actual database schema (not descriptions)
- ✓ Multiple value formats are handled for relevant columns
- ✓ String comparisons are case-insensitive where appropriate
- ✓ Date ranges are correctly calculated
- ✓ JOINs use proper keys and conditions
- ✓ Aggregations have appropriate GROUP BY clauses
- ✓ Column aliases are meaningful and clear

TABLE_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT = """You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to infer and describe database table semantics based on table name, column name and sample data values. 

### Given:
{table_info}

### Instructions:
1. Analyze the table name, column names and sample values to infer a clear, human-readable **description** of what the table represents.
2. generate a list of **distinct possible user queries** and corresponding **SQL templates** that can be used to query this table.
3. For each column, infer a clear, human-readable **description** of what the column, represents.
4. Follow the exact output json format below.

### Output Format:
```json
{{
  "table_name": "<table_name>",
  "table_description": "<concise explanation of the table meaning>",
  "example_user_queries": [
    {{
      "user_query": "<example natural language question>",
      "sql_template": "<corresponding SQL query template with placeholders>"
    }},
    ...
  ]
}}
``` 
### OUTPUT RULES:
- Ensure the output is valid JSON.  
- Ensoure the JSON is enclosed in triple backticks (```) and labeled as json for easy extraction.
- Use placeholders in the SQL template for any user-specific values (e.g., `<country_name>`, `<start_date>`, `<end_date>`).
- Do not include any actual data values in the SQL templates, only use placeholders.
- Ensure the SQL templates are syntactically correct and follow best practices.
- Use comments in the SQL templates to explain any non-obvious mappings or logic
- Use double quotes for all JSON keys and string values.
- If you cannot infer the table meaning, respond with "Unknown" for the table description.

Given:
{columns_info}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the most frequent used query and SQL templates to understand how the column is used in practice if it is presented.
2. Analyze the column name and sample values to infer a clear, human-readable **description** of what the column represents.
3. List all **distinct possible values**, including "null" or "blank" if applicable.
4. Identify and group **equivalent variations** of the same concept (e.g., capitalization, abbreviations, typos, or alternative spellings).
5. Provide a **normalization rule** or note explaining how to handle variations (e.g., using `UPPER()` for comparisons).
6. "Sample Values" should include all distinct formats observed in the sample data, do not include all possible values if there are too many, just representative ones.
7. Follow the exact output format below.

Output Format:
```
Column: <column_name>
Description: <concise explanation of the column meaning>
Sample Values:
